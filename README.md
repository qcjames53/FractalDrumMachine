# Fractal Drum Machine
Fractal drum machine is a project to render a measure composed of a reasonable number of drum beats as an interactive fractal. Selecting a coordinate on the visible grid will play the notes (Bass, Snare, Hi-Hat, Rest) needed to reach that point.

### Some example beats:
* Amen break
  * Use 4/4 time, 16th note beats, and 120 beats per minute.
  * Coordinates: `1158, 64895`
  * Pattern: `B-B-S-BSHSB-S-H-`
