# Fractal Drum Machine
Fractal drum machine is a project to render a measure composed of a reasonable number of drum beats as an interactive fractal. Selecting a coordinate on the visible grid will play the notes (Bass, Snare, Hi-Hat, Rest) needed to reach that point.

### Some example beats:
* Amen break
    * Use 4/4 time, 16th note beats, and 120 beats per minute.
    * Coordinates: `1158, 64895`
    * Pattern: `B-B-S-BSHSB-S-H-`
* Boots n Cats
    * Use 4/4 time, quarter note beats, and 240 beats per minute.
    * Coordinates: `1, 10`
    * Pattern: `BHSH`
*  Third sanctuary
    * Use 11/8 time, 16th note beats, and 340 beats per minute
    * Coordinates: `65818, 4194302`
    * Pattern: `B-B-S-B-B-B-S-B-S-H-HH`
